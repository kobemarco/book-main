## **About This Compilation** 

This site is the official compilation of my work for **DS413 – Elective 4 (Deep Learning)**.  
It showcases the outputs of my laboratory exercises and projects in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

This Jupyter Book is designed to:  
- Provide a **structured documentation** of my work in DS413, covering all exercises and projects.  
- Highlight both **my theoretical understanding and practical skills** in deep learning, from concepts applied in activities to project implementations.  
- Serve as a **portfolio of my work**, highlighting my project workflows and the deep learning frameworks I applied throughout the course.
