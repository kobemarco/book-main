    "\n",
    "The core of our study centers on analyzing the ICBHI 2017 Respiratory Sound Database, a challenging, unstructured dataset containing 6,898 pulmonary sound cycles labeled as normal, crackle, wheeze, or both. We confirmed the dataset's reliability and established a clear rationale for addressing the underexplored area of sound analysis in medicine.\n",

    "My primary contribution is writing the background of the study, specifically focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Burden of CRDs**: High global incidence and mortality (asthma, COPD), with 55M+ new cases and 4.4M deaths; declining age-standardized mortality reflects improved management but regional disparities persist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regional & Philippine Context**: Southeast Asia faces heavy CRD burden (≈12% of all deaths), driven by pollution and socioeconomic risks; in the Philippines, COPD prevalence is high (20.8% in ≥40 years) with major financial strain on patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disease Overview & Public Health Needs**: CRDs include COPD, asthma, ILD, pneumonia, and lung cancer, causing symptoms like breathlessness and chronic cough; driven by smoking, pollution, infections, and occupational exposures—reinforcing the need for targeted interventions and improved healthcare access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚧 Current Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently bottlenecked on selecting the initial models for experimentation due to constraints on testing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Suggested Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently manage time and overcome the model selection hurdle, we should implement a phased approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Establish a Baseline**: Quickly test a simple model \n",
    "**Core Experiment**: Prioritize 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (2D CNNs) using Mel Spectrograms as input, as these are highly effective for audio classification.\n",
    "**Execute Strategically**: Perform initial hyperparameter tuning on a small data subset before running the final tests on the full dataset."
